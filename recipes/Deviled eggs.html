        <p>These deviled eggs are delicious for Easter brunch 
            and are always popular at our holiday parties. 
            Adjust the amount of salt and sugar in this recipe 
            to suit your taste. I like to add onion and celery 
            for a little more texture.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> This recipe yields 12 deviled egg halves, so you'll need six boiled eggs</li>
            <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> Mayonnaise makes the filling extra creamy.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> A teaspoon of white vinegar, meanwhile, cuts the sweetness with acidity</li>

            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You'll need an onion and celery.</li>
